# dotfiles-sxwm
just an installscript for my sxwm setup (not using it, just playing with it in VM)

# Automatic install:
```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Syntr1x/dotfiles-sxwm/master/install.sh)"
```
If you use the script and want the polybar toggle to work, just nano into ~/.config/sxwmrc and change the bind with your username, i dont know why it doesnt work with the $USER but welp.
